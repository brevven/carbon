# Settings

[mod-setting-name]
bzcarbon-recipe-bypass=Bypass recipes
bzcarbon-list=Make a list of modified recipes
bzcarbon-enable-fullerenes=Enable fullerenes & nanotubes
bzcarbon-enable-carbon-black=Enable carbon black
bzcarbon-enable-rough-diamond=Enable diamond mining
bzcarbon-enable-flake-graphite=Enable flake graphite
bzcarbon-reuse=Reuse grinding grit
bzcarbon-enable-carbon-fiber=Enable carbon fiber

[mod-setting-description]
bzcarbon-recipe-bypass=Skip modifying these recipes (comma-separated list).
bzcarbon-list=If enabled, the text command [color=orange]BZList[/color] will dump a file to the script-output directory with a full list of recipes modified.\nRecommended to turn this off after you are done configuring your other settings.
bzcarbon-enable-fullerenes=Enable the fullerenes & nanotubes intermediate products.\nFullerenes are used primarily in bio-related things. Nanotubes for structures.
bzcarbon-enable-carbon-black=Enable carbon black byproduct. Primarily used to make plastics.
bzcarbon-enable-rough-diamond=Enables very rare diamond ore patches for new games.
bzcarbon-enable-flake-graphite=Enables graphite ore patches. Recommended to leave this on. Turning off will remove existing ore patches.
bzcarbon-reuse=A chance to reuse diamond grinding grit in recipes like LDS. More complex, but saves resources.
bzcarbon-enable-carbon-fiber=Only available when Salt & Chlorine is active

[string-mod-setting]
bzcarbon-enable-flake-graphite-yes=yes - recommended
